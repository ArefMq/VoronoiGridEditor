# VoronoiGridEditor

This is a qt gui application, which is developed in Linux.
This project has tested only on debian, so I do not know
if it is working on any other platforms or not, but since
it is a Qt-based application it might run on Windows and
Mac as well.

Before you can build this project you need the following
dependencies on Linux:
1) Qt-SDK
2) C++-4.9
3) Make

To make the project in Linux follow the procedure below:
1) clone the project and enter the root directory of the
   project

2) Run these command in the folder:
    qmake
    make

3) And finally run the compiled application.

Alternatively, you can open the "hgc.pro" file with Qt-
creator SDK. If you do that, you need to re-configure the
project and then simply build it and run it.

If you have any comment on this project and/or if you find
any trouble on using it, or if you found any bugs in this
application, just let me know by this mail:
